Install and configure docker
	- https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-windows-10
	- choco install docker
Add a shared drive: C (in Configure the resources. I set 2 CPSs and 2048MB Memory)
Set Docker to run on startup
	- start > startup apps
	- Docker Desktop > On
At this point, run ipconfig and check if there is a network with ip of 10.0.75.1. If there is, skip this, if not, then
	- setup a virtual adapter in hyperv
	- Virtual switch manager
	- New virtual network switch
	- Internal network
	- Don't enable the vlanid

	- Assign to the vm
		- Right click on the docker vm, settings
		- Select the new virtual switch
		- I dont think you need to enable the virtual lan identification. Try without, try with only if you have issues
		- Configure the network adapter
		- run ipconfig /all, and take a note of the following
		- Subnet mask from the Default Switch ethernet adapter vEthernet
		- Default Gateway from Ethernet adapter Ethernet
		- Dns server address from Ethernet adapter Ethernet                                       
	- Configure the switch
		- Head over to Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Centre
		- Click on the vEthernet(your net NAT)
		- Properties
			- Tick Internet Protocol Version 4
			- Select properties
			- Set IP address to 10.0.75.1
			- Subnet mask from above
			- Default gateway from above
			- DNS server addresses from above
	- Can now ping -a 10.0.75.1, or, assuming you have iis installed, can hit in a browser

Configure SQLEXPRESS for connection from container
	- C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager14.msc
	- SQL Server Network Configuration
	- Protocols for SQLEXPRESS
	- TCP/IP Right properties
	- PROTOCOL: Enabled: Yes, Listen All: Yes
	- IP ADDRESSES: TCP Port: 1433
	- Do this for every ip entry in that list - not just the top one!
	- Restart SQLEXPRESS
		- EITHER: Powershell restart-service -Force 'MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS'
		- OR start > Services > Right click SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS) > Restart
Configure local firewall to allow access to SQL on port 1433
	- start > Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
	- Inbound rules
	- New Rule
	- Port > Next
	- TCP, Specific local ports 1433[-1434?] > Next
	- Allow the connection > Next
	- Tick all > Next
	- Enter a name > Finish
	- Show it works by connecting in SSMS
		- Server name: tcp:10.0.75.1,1433
