# AssortedTools

A set of assorted tools that help me go about my working day.

There are 

- scripts that can manage AKS clusters
- scripts that can undo the automatically added language settings (This bugs the ever loving life out of me, since I tend to want to switch quickly between two particular keyboard settings, and finding that a third has appeared automatically is a real annoyance)
- my git alias' that I find super useful

You're welcome to take a look, but these are not intended for wider consumption. If you like what you see, by all means use, but you'll need to edit them according to your own needs
